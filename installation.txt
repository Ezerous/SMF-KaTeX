This package renders TeX expressions using KaTeX (https://katex.org/).
It adds two buttons to the editor that provide the [tex] and [tex=inline] tags. Use those tags to wrap a TeX expression and it will be rendered automatically.
If you are you using multiple themes make sure to copy 'tex.gif' and 'tex-inline.gif' from Themes/default/images/bbc to the respective directories of the other themes.
